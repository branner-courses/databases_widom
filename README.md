## Databases Widom

This repository is meant to hold my efforts following Jennifer Widom's introductory course in databases.

Online versions of the course include:

 * [the 2014 Stanford version](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/db/2014_1/about), which runs from 20140106-0322. An "informal Statement of Accomplishment" can be issued on completion of the course.
 * [the 2011 Coursera version](https://class.coursera.org/db), now in "self-service" mode â€” automated grading and an unmonitore forum exist, but no certificate is issued.

The book is Jeffrey D. Ullum and Jennifer Widom, _A First Course in Database Systems_, 3rd ed.
