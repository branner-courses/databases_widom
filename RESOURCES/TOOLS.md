### RA Relational Algebra Interpreter
 
Exercises are done using Jun Yang's [RA Relational Algebra Interpreter](http://www.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/ra/). Installation is described under the "Software Guides" tab of the Stanford course site. After installation of `ra.jar` and the three sample files from the course site, run the RA REPL from the command line with
 
    java -jar ra.jar
 
To exit the REPL, use `\quit;`; for a list of commands, use `\list;`.
